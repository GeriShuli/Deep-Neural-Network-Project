Deep Learning Framework for Land Use and Land Cover Classification

This repository presents a deep learning pipeline for satellite image scene classification using the EuroSAT dataset. The project focuses on methodological rigor in transfer learning, rather than architectural novelty, and demonstrates how structured training and fine-tuning strategies can achieve state-of-the-art performance.
